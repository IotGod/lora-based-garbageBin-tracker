This repo consists of source code for node, gateway and mobile app for this [blog post](http://radiostud.io/smart-garbage-biâ€¦cker-using-lpwan/).

# OVERVIEW

This Project Demonstrates how to integrate the LoRa gateway with the raspberry pi, track the garbage bin data from node and visiualize it on Mobile App.

# Setting up Build Environment for Android & Cordova

Step 1: Install GIT using the following command using your terminal,

		sudo apt-get install git
Step 2: Change the directory to $HOME

		cd $HOME
Step 3: Install nodejs using the following,

		sudo apt-get install nodejs
		sudo apt-get install nodejs-legacy
Step 4: Creating a symbolic link for the nodejs

		sudo ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node
**check install : nodejs --version

Step 5: Install npm

		sudo apt-get instal npm
**check install : npm --version

Step 6: Update & install gcc-multilib

		sudo apt-get update
		sudo apt-get install gcc-multilib
Step 7: Install cordova latest version,

		sudo su -c "npm install -g cordova"
(Step 8, 9 , 10 - if bplist-parser,path-is-absolute,inflight files are missing)

Step 8: sudo npm install -g bplist-parser

Step 9: sudo npm install -g path-is-absolute

Step 10:sudo npm install -g inflight

**check install: cordova --version

Step 11: Install Java

The Android SDK needs the Java Development Kit (JDK) to be installed (minimum version 1.6). Note that the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is not sufficient, you will need the JDK. To check if you have the JDK installed already, type this in a terminal window:

		java -version
		javac -version
If version info is displayed, you have Java installed, but you may want to use the Oracle JDK, rather than the OpenJDK that comes with many Linux distributions. The Oracle JDK is needed for signing Android apps.

If you wish to install the Oracle JDK, proceed as follows (the steps below are based on a guide from wikiHow):

Start by removing the OpenJDK:

		sudo apt-get purge openjdk-\*
			sudo apt-get autoremove
Find out if you have a 32-bit och 64-bit Linux version:

			file /sbin/init
If you run 64-bit Linux, you should install 32-bit libraries (Android SDK will need this):

		sudo apt-get install ia32-libs
Download the JDK (Java SE Development Kit). The download file ends with .tar.gz. For 32-bit systems get the "Linux x86" download, for 64-bit systems get the "Linux x64" download.

The downloaded file is typically saved to the folder "Download" in your home directory. The following steps create an installation directory and unpack the JDK files there. You can pick any directory for the install, we will use the directory "java" in the home folder. Replace "jdk-8u11-linux-i586.tar.gz" with the name of the file you just downloaded.

		mkdir -p ~/java
		cd  ~/Downloads
		mv jdk-8u11-linux-i586.tar.gz ~/java
		cd ~/java
		tar xvzf jdk-8u11-linux-i586.tar.gz
		rm jdk-8u11-linux-i586.tar.gz
Check the name of the JDK install directory with:

		ls
The path to the JDK becomes "~/java/jdk1.8.0_11" where "jdk1.8.0_11" is the name displayed by the ls command.

Add the path to the JDK by editing .bashrc in your home directory. You can use for example nano or gedit for this:

		nano ~/.bashrc
or:

		gedit ~/.bashrc
Add the following to the end of the file (replace "jdk1.8.0_11" with the actual folder name!):

		JAVA_HOME=~/java/jdk1.8.0_66
		PATH=$PATH:~/java/jdk1.8.0_66/bin
		export JAVA_HOME
Edit the .bash_profile file to load .bashrc. Opening a terminal windows runs .bash_profile, and we want our path settings to be available in the terminal. If not already present, add the following lines to .bash_profile (se nano or gedit as above):

		if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then
		   source ~/.bashrc
		fi
Now you are ready to test the install. Close any open terminal windows, open a new terminal and type:

    		javac -version
			java -version
If version info is displayed you are done with the JDK install!

Step 12: Install Ant

Apache Ant is a build system for Java, which is used by Cordova and the Android SDK. To install Ant, follow these steps:

Download Ant from here: ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi. Get the zip download available at the page. Click the zip-file link for the most recent release, e.g. apache-ant-1.9.4-bin.zip, and save the file to your machine.

Unpack the zip file to the directory on your machine where you want Ant to be installed. You can pick any directory for the install, we will use the directory "ant" in the home folder. Here are the commands (make sure you use the actual name of the downloaded zip file):

		mkdir -p ~/ant
		cd ~/ant
		unzip apache-ant-1.9.4-bin.zip
		rm apache-ant-1.9.4-bin.zip
To add Ant to the system path, edit .bashrc to contain the following lines at the end. Again, be careful to use the actual names of the files and folders on your system:

		JAVA_HOME=~/java/jdk1.8.0_66
		PATH=$PATH:~/java/jdk1.8.0_66/bin
		export JAVA_HOME
		
		ANT_HOME=~/ant/apache-ant-1.9.6
		PATH=$PATH:~/ant/apache-ant-1.9.6/bin
		export ANT_HOME
		
		export PATH
Now test the install. Close the terminal window, open a new terminal (to make settings take effect) and type:

		ant -version
If you see a version number you have installed Ant successfully!

Step 13: Install the Android SDK Tools

The SDK Tools for Android are used by Cordova to build Android apps. Follow these steps to install the SDK Tools:

Go to the page developer.android.com/sdk scroll down the page and click "VIEW ALL DOWNLOADS AND SIZES". Under "SDK Tools Only", click the windows installer file for Linux and download it (this file is named e.g. android-sdk_r23.0.2-linux.tgz).

When downloaded, unpack the files. Here are commands for unpacking the Android SDK folder into your home directory:

		cd
		mv ~/Downloads/android-sdk_r23.0.2-linux.tgz .
		tar zxvf android-sdk_r23.0.2-linux.tgz
		rm android-sdk_r23.0.2-linux.tgz
The unpacked folder is named "android-sdk-linux" as of the release used in this example.

The Android SDK Tools need to be added to the system path. Edit .bashrc to contain the following lines at the end. Make sure you use the actual names of the files and folders on your system:

		JAVA_HOME=~/java/jdk1.8.0_66
		PATH=$PATH:~/java/jdk1.8.0_66/bin
		export JAVA_HOME
		
		ANT_HOME=~/ant/apache-ant-1.9.6
		PATH=$PATH:~/ant/apache-ant-1.9.6/bin
		export ANT_HOME
		
		PATH=$PATH:~/android-sdk-linux/platform-tools
		PATH=$PATH:~/android-sdk-linux/tools
		
		export PATH
You need to have the specific Android SDK version used by Cordova. This is done by running the Android SDK Manager by typing the command:

		android
This launches a window where you can select to install specific Android SDKs.

First time you launch the Android SDK Manager there will be preset selections. It is recommended to leave these untouched. Also select the entry "Android 4.4.2 (API 19)" is not installed already. This is the version used by the current Cordova 3.5 version. Note that the Android SDK required by Cordova will change in the future, as new versions of Cordova and Android are released. When this happens, open the Android SDK Manager again, and install the required API version(s).

- To test the install, close the terminal window, open a new terminal and type:

			adb version

- This should display version info for the Android Debug Bridge.
If You Get Stuck

If you get stuck, consult the documentation at the respective web sites for Cordova, Java, Ant, and Android. The Cordova documentation specific for Android is found here: cordova.apache.org/docs/en/3.6.0/guide_platforms_android_index.md.html. You are also welcome to ask for help at the Evothings Forum.

One thing to do is to inspect all the environment variables. You can do this from a command window (note that you have to open a new command window after updating environment variables for updated values to be available). This displays the system PATH:

		echo $PATH
Here is how to inspect the values of JAVA_HOME and ANT_HOME:

		echo $JAVA_HOME
		echo $ANT_HOME
    
## MOBILE APP BUILD

Steps to be followed to Build and Run the Android App for Smart Parking System

Step 1 : Change the directory to the lora-based-garbageBin-tracker/app

 			cd lora-based-garbageBin-tracker/app
Step 2 : Modify the pubnub publish and subscribe keys at www/js/index.js

Step 3: In the config.xml file in the root folder change the name of the app to the name you want. This is optional step. By default the app name is "Trash Can"

Step 4: Build the app by executing the following command in the terminal in the root folder of the cordova app

    cordova build android
Step 5: Once build is successful, you can find the generated apk file in the following path relative to the cordova project root directory.

    /platforms/android/build/outputs/apk

Step 4 : Once the .apk file is build successfully, you will find the app at this path

 			./platforms/android/ant-build/android_debug.apk
Step 5 : Install the App on an Android Phone. Follow the steps in README file to use the app.
